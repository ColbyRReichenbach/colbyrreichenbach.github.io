# Ad Performance Analysis & A/B Testing

## Project Overview
This project analyzes ad campaign data to identify key factors driving ad performance and conversion rates. By moving beyond simple "clicks," it focuses on statistical validation to determine which creative elements actually drive sales.

## Key Highlights
*   **Top Performer identified:** Discovered that **Campaign 916** achieved a significantly higher conversion rate (**14.16%**) compared to the baseline.
*   **Statistical Validation:** Used **Chi-Square tests** and **T-tests** to prove that creative elements (headlines, visuals) had a statistically significant impact on conversion, while demographic targeting showed no significant difference.
*   **Funnel Optimization:** Identified a critical bottleneck in the **Impressions-to-Clicks (CTR)** stage, leading to a recommendation for rapid A/B testing of ad creatives rather than audience segmentation.

## Tech Stack
*   **Python**: Core analysis logic.
*   **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and aggregation.
*   **SciPy**: Statistical testing (Chi-square, T-test).
*   **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
*   **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive analysis environment.
