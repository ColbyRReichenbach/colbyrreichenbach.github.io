# Customer Churn AI

## Project Overview
A predictive analytics project focused on understanding and preventing customer churn in the telecommunications sector. It combines deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Machine Learning to flag at-risk customers before they leave.

## Key Highlights
*   **Deep EDA:** Uncovered that **month-to-month contracts** and **electronic check payments** were the highest predictors of churn.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Trained and tuned Machine Learning models (**Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**) to predict churn probability.
*   **Actionable Insights:** Delivered a prioritized list of at-risk customers and recommended specific retention strategies (e.g., incentivizing 1-year contracts).
*   **Data Cleaning:** Robust pipeline handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.

## Tech Stack
*   **Python**: Machine Leaning pipeline.
*   **Scikit-Learn**: Model training and evaluation.
*   **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting for high-performance prediction.
*   **Pandas & NumPy**: Data processing.
*   **Jupyter**: Analysis and reporting.
